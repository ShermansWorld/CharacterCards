# CharacterCards
# Version 1.0

CharacterCards is heavily inspired by ICCards, originally developed by r0m3x/Explode in May of 2017.

Description:
CharacterCards is a simple plugin that adds character cards to your server. 
Character cards are designed for RPG servers. They provide an easy way for players to get an overview of another player's character,
as well as allowing them to set an overview for their own character. Character cards are purely aesthetic and do not have in-game effects.
